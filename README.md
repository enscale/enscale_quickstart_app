[Enscale](https://enscale.com) is a new, Ruby-focused cloud hosting solution brought to you by [Layershift](https://enscale.com/about-us).

The purpose of this application is to familiarize yourself with some essential features in Enscale that will help you put your custom app in the cloud much faster.

The design of the Quickstart app is not meant to be a coding model to follow for your custom applications. As the purpose of the app is to guide you through certain actions and check the result, you may find some of the code to be unconventional. Your application shouldn't need any special modifications to be compatible with Enscale.

To get started, you will need:

- an Enscale account (create your trial account on https://enscale.com )
- an [Enscale environment](https://www.enscale.com/docs/10/getting-started/create-environment) with an Nginx application node

Once you have these, you can [deploy the Quickstart app](https://www.enscale.com/docs/10/deployments/git) and complete the goals from the application to get a reward.

You can also find a detailed walkthrough for the Quickstart app complete with screenshots from creating the environment to claiming the reward [here](https://www.enscale.com/docs/10/account-and-billing/trial-account/quickstart-app).

We hope you will find this app useful for trying the waters and you'll host your app on Enscale too!

For any assistance with the Quickstart app or questions about Enscale, don't hesitate to [reach out to us](https://enscale.com/support).
